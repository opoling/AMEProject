# AMEProject for CodePath

Titled “AMEProject” (stands for "Anotia/Microtia Ear Project"), the purpose of the website is to create a community space for anyone who has an ear birth defect called anotia/microtia. The website will educate anyone who is not familiar with the birth defect and also provide resources and laws that are being implemented for the hearing-impaired community.

Users who are not familiar with anotia/microtia and users who want to support people with ear birth defects. 

Users would be able to learn about people’s stories with the defect, learn about the background of the defect, and provide support for passing laws and/or donate to organizations through hyperlinks.
