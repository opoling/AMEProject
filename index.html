    <h2>What is Anotia/Microtia Ears (AMEs)</h2>
    <p>
      Microtia is a congenital anomaly affecting the outer ear (pinna) where the ear does not fully develop during the
      first trimester of pregnancy. A Microtia ear is often smaller in size, can have a peanut shaped appearance, only
      have a small nub or lobe present, or be completely absent at birth. Microtia is Latin for the words micro and
      otia, meaning “little ear.” Microtia can affect one ear (unilaterally) or both ears (bilaterally). Microtia occurs
      in every 1 out of 6,000 to 12,000 births. The right ear is more commonly affected. Microtia is often accompanied
      by Anotia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anotia (also known as aural atresia) is the absence or closure of the external auditory ear canal. The
      malformation of the middle ear bones (incus, stapes, and malleus) may be affected including the narrowing of the
      ear canal, known as canal stenosis. Anotia is Latin for absence of an opening.

  <div class="challenges">
    <h2>Individuals with AME are Faced With...</h2>
    <p>People with anotia or microtia ears may face a range of physical, functional, and psychosocial challenges as a
      result of their condition. These challenges that they face can be listed:
    <ol>
      <li>Functional Challenges: External ear serves the purposes of sound collection and localization. The absence or
        underdevelopment of it can affect an individual's ability to hear and perveice sounds in a natural way.</li>
      <li>Pscyhological and Emotional Impact: Individuals may experience anxiiety, depression, or social isolation due
        to
        the challenges they face related to their appearance and hearing.</li>
      <li>Cost and Accessibility: Access to specialized medical care and surgical interventions can be limited around
        the
        world. These treatments can be very costly, putting fincancial challenges for individuals and their families.

    <h3>Data Informations: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Among 25, 802, 806 births, 3,993 cases of microtia were diagnosed</li>
      <li>An overall prevalence of 1.55 per 10,000 births (CI: 1.50–1.60)</li>
      <li>A median value was 0.76 with an interquartile range between 0.50 and 1.56 and an overall range between zero
        (Malta) and 5.01 (South America ECLAMC)</li>
      <li>The highest rates (last decile) were observed, in order of increasing prevalence, in Chile Maule (2.54), Utah
        -USA (2.62), Texas-USA (2.66), and South America ECLAMC (5.01) programs</li>

  <!--- Impact --->
  <div class="impact">
    <h2>Impact!</h2>
    <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Since Microtia can result in the external ear looking different from the norm, it can lead to sel-esteem issues
      and
      a negative body image. This can persist throughout a person's life due to the psychological impact of feeling
      self-conscious about one's appearance.
    </p>

    <h3>Where else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Due to the potential negative psychological well-being, microtia can affect social interactions and relations
      with
      peers. Individuals with the birth defect can feel self-conscious in social situations and may be subject to
      teasing
      or bullying; resulting in lasting effects on current and their future social skills and interpersonal
      relationships.
    </p>
    <h3>Where else else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Having a birth defect that can be visible, individuals with microtia may face educational challenges--especially
      if
      they exerience hearing loss. This can impact their academic performance and future educational and career
      opportunities. It may require ongoing edudcational support and accommodations.
