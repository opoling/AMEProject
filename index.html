    result of their condition. These challenges that they face can be listed:
  <ol>

      underdevelopment of it can affect an individual's ability to hear and perveice sounds in a natural way.</li>
    <li>Pscyhological and Emotional Impact: Individuals may experience anxiiety, depression, or social isolation due to
      the challenges they face related to their appearance and hearing.</li>
    <li>Cost and Accessibility: Access to specialized medical care and surgical interventions can be limited around the
      world. These treatments can be very costly, putting fincancial challenges for individuals and their families.</li>
