    <h2>About the AME Project</h2>
    <p>People with anotia or microtia ears may face a range of physical, functional, and psychosocial challenges as a
      result of their condition. These challenges that they face can be listed:
    <ol>
      <li>Functional Challenges: External ear serves the purposes of sound collection and localization. The absence or
        underdevelopment of it can affect an individual's ability to hear and perveice sounds in a natural way.</li>
      <li>Pscyhological and Emotional Impact: Individuals may experience anxiiety, depression, or social isolation due
        to
        the challenges they face related to their appearance and hearing.</li>
      <li>Cost and Accessibility: Access to specialized medical care and surgical interventions can be limited around
        the
        world. These treatments can be very costly, putting fincancial challenges for individuals and their families.

  <div class="impact">
    <h2>Impact!</h2>
    <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Since Microtia can result in the external ear looking different from the norm, it can lead to sel-esteem issues
      and
      a negative body image. This can persist throughout a person's life due to the psychological impact of feeling
      self-conscious about one's appearance.
    </p>

    <h3>Where else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Due to the potential negative psychological well-being, microtia can affect social interactions and relations
      with
      peers. Individuals with the birth defect can feel self-conscious in social situations and may be subject to
      teasing
      or bullying; resulting in lasting effects on current and their future social skills and interpersonal
      relationships.
    </p>
    <h3>Where else else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Having a birth defect that can be visible, individuals with microtia may face educational challenges--especially
      if
      they exerience hearing loss. This can impact their academic performance and future educational and career
      opportunities. It may require ongoing edudcational support and accommodations.
